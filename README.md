Designed and developed an AI Agent application using LangChain, capable of autonomously reasoning and executing multi-step tasks. The agent leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand complex user queries, dynamically select appropriate tools (search, APIs, databases), and generate actionable responses. Integrated vector databases for knowledge retrieval and memory management, enabling the agent to perform context-aware decision-making over long interactions. Deployed the system on cloud infrastructure ensuring scalability and real-time responsiveness. Implemented custom prompt engineering, toolchains, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) strategies to enhance the agentâ€™s reliability and efficiency in production.

Key Technologies:

LangChain agents and toolkits

Open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama 2, Mistral)

Vector DBs (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone)
